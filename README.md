## üîç Project Overview

This service is designed to send emails in a **reliable and efficient** manner. It integrates essential backend engineering concepts like:
- Retry mechanisms with backoff
- Provider fallback
- Request idempotency
- Rate limiting
- Status tracking

The goal is to ensure that emails are sent exactly once, even in the face of failure or high traffic.

## üöÄ Core Features

‚úÖ **Retry with Exponential Backoff**  
‚úÖ **Fallback to Secondary Email Provider**  
‚úÖ **Idempotent Email Sending (No Duplicates)**  
‚úÖ **Basic Rate Limiting**  
‚úÖ **Status Tracking by Email ID**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayaliPatil10/resilient-email-service.git
cd resilient-email-service


2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure you have your AWS credentials set up. You can do this by configuring the AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Deploy the Service**:
   Use AWS SAM to deploy the service:
   ```bash
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

5. **Test the Service**:
   You can test the service using Postman or curl. Make a POST request to the API Gateway endpoint with the required email data.

## Usage

After deploying the service, you can use the API to send emails. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to make a request:

### Send Email

**Endpoint**: `POST /send-email`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Test Email",
  "body": "This is a demo message."
}
```

**Example Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api-gateway-url/send-email \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"to": "recipient@example.com", "subject": "Test Email", "body": "This is a demo message."}'
```

### Check Status

You can check the status of sent emails using the following endpoint:

**Endpoint**: `GET /email-status/{emailId}`

Replace `{emailId}` with the actual ID returned when you sent the email.
